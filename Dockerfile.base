# This image is based on Debian instead of e.g. Alpine as at the time of its
# creation there were binaries (e.g. biber) that were not distributed for the
# Linux/MUSL platform (at least not via default TeX Live). Now downstream
# images rely on this, so do not change the base OS without good reason.
